ðŸŽ¯ Missing Indicator & Random Sample Imputation in Machine Learning
This project focuses on handling missing numerical data in a Machine Learning pipeline using two effective strategies: Missing Indicator and Random Sample Imputation. It demonstrates how these methods impact model performance through practical implementation and visualization.

ðŸ“Œ Key Features
Identifies missing values in numerical columns (Age, Fare).

Implements:

Missing Indicator Imputation

Random Sample Imputation

Builds a machine learning pipeline using scikit-learn.

Uses GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.

Visualizes feature distributions before and after imputation using KDE plots.

Compares model performance across imputation strategies.

ðŸ§ª Technologies Used
Python

Pandas: for data manipulation

NumPy: for numerical operations

Seaborn & Matplotlib: for visualization

Scikit-learn:

SimpleImputer, Pipeline, ColumnTransformer

LogisticRegression, GridSearchCV
